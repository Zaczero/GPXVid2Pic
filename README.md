# GPXVid2Pic

This is my personal workflow tool for Mapillary, used to create geo-tagged images from a GPX track and a video file.

Please note that this tool is poorly made and WILL require adjustments to suit your use case. I have decided to publish it solely to provide guidance to others.

Please refrain from judging the quality of the code, as it was hacked together some time ago.

I may rewrite this tool in the future, but for now it works for me.
